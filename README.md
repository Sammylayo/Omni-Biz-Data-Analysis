## Data Cleaning <a name="b"></a>
Data cleaning is a crucial step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. The steps taken include:

- Removing Unwanted Characters: Titles and special characters are removed from customer names.

- Removing Numbers: Numbers are removed from customer names to maintain clarity.
- Checking for Duplicates: Duplicates in the sales records are identified and handled appropriately.

## SQL Analysis <a name="c"></a>
Several SQL queries were crafted to extract valuable insights from the sales data:

- Total Sales and Quantity by Category: Calculate the total sales amount and quantity sold for each product category, along with the corresponding sales employee's information and commission earned.
- Top 3 Employees: Identify the top 3 employees based on the total sales amount, including their commission percentage.
- Top 5 Customers: Find the top 5 customers based on total spending and the number of orders placed.
- Sales Distribution by Source: Analyze the distribution of sales orders across different sources and calculate the percentage contribution of each source.

## Visualization<a name="d"></a>
Visualization tools are employed to provide a clear and interactive representation of the sales data. Key visualizations include:

Sales Over Time: Trend analysis of total sales amount over time.
- Top Product Categories: Highlighting the highest-selling product categories.
