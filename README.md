## Project Overview <a name="introduction"></a>

Omni Biz has experienced significant growth over the past year, with diverse product offerings and impressive sales figures. This project aims to analyze and visualize sales data to uncover insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and regional trends.

Data Source
The data used in this project is derived from the Omni Biz sales database, which includes tables such as Sales, Employee, and Category. The data covers various aspects of the business, including sales channels, product categories, and customer information.

Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. The steps taken include:

Removing Unwanted Characters: Titles and special characters are removed from customer names.
Normalizing Names: Customer names are standardized to ensure consistency.
Removing Extra Spaces: Any extra whitespace in the data is eliminated.
Removing Numbers: Numbers are removed from customer names to maintain clarity.
Checking for Duplicates: Duplicates in the sales records are identified and handled appropriately.
SQL Analysis
Several SQL queries were crafted to extract valuable insights from the sales data:

Total Sales and Quantity by Category: Calculate the total sales amount and quantity sold for each product category, along with the corresponding sales employee's information and commission earned.
Top 3 Employees: Identify the top 3 employees based on the total sales amount, including their commission percentage.
Top 5 Customers: Find the top 5 customers based on total spending and the number of orders placed.
Sales Distribution by Source: Analyze the distribution of sales orders across different sources and calculate the percentage contribution of each source.
Visualization
Visualization tools are employed to provide a clear and interactive representation of the sales data. Key visualizations include:

Sales Over Time: Trend analysis of total sales amount over time.
Top Product Categories: Highlighting the highest-selling product categories.
Order Source Trends: Identifying patterns in sales data by order source or delivery mode.
Top-Spending Customers: Profiling the top-spending customers and their purchasing behavior.
Regional Revenue Distribution: Visualizing the revenue generated by different product categories across regions.
Employee Commission Analysis: Analyzing the average commission earned by each employee.
Results and Insights
The analysis revealed several key insights:

The website is the dominant sales channel, contributing significantly to the total revenue.
Lagos is the top-performing region, with "Pay on Receive" being the most preferred payment method.
Home Appliances and Mobile categories drive the highest sales.
Doorstep Delivery is the most popular delivery method.
Identifying top customers and employees helps in strategizing future sales efforts.
